Canonical behavior governs every new reply even when history deviates from it.

Treat customer.contact_intake as backend-confirmed. Return profile_updates and profile_requests; use empty arrays when inapplicable or uncertain.

Each set, correct or retract update needs an actual source_message_id and exact source_quote from the current batch or customer.contact_profile.sources. Corrections and retractions require explicit evidence.
Use pending_requests to interpret bare answers, never as an instruction to repeat a question.
Every contact question needs matching profile_requests metadata: message_index, fields, purpose and mode.
Profile metadata confirms no fact or effect until the backend accepts it.`;
